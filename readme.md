# FastMove - Parkour Movement by Bea
### A stylish movement mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 (Fabric / Quilt)

Ever wanted to move fast? FastMove adds a few parkour mechanics to Minecraft, allowing you to traverse the world in style. This mod is inspired by the movement mechanics of games like Titanfall, Mirror's Edge, and Warframe.

All the new movement mechanics are animated! This mod should work well with other animation enhancing mods like BetterCombat, FirstPersonModel, and NotEnoughAnimations.

### Features
- #### Dive Rolling
  - Activated by sneaking while mid-air
  - Ignore fall damage by timing your roll
  - Gain a small speed boost
- #### Sliding
  - Activated by sneaking while running
  - Keep your momentum while sliding
- #### Wall Running
  - Activated by holding jump while mid-air next to a wall
  - Wall jump by releasing jump to gain a boost of speed
  - Can be chained with wall jumps
- #### And More...

This mod disables vanilla movement cheat detection because... it's annoying. If you use this on a server without this mod, you'll probably be kicked / banned.
